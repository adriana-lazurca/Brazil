    <strong>Brazil</strong> is the largest country in South America and the fifth largest nation in the world. 
    It forms an enormous triangle on the eastern side of the continent with a 7,400km coastline along the Atlantic Ocean. 
    It has borders with every South American country except Chile and Ecuador.

    The Brazilian landscape is very varied. 
    It is most well known for its dense forests, including the <cite>Amazon</cite>, the world’s largest rainforest, in the north. 
    But there are also dry grasslands (called pampas), rugged hills, pine forests, sprawling wetlands, immense plateaus (areas of level high ground) and a long coastal plain.

                    <h3> Rio de Janeiro</h3>
                    <section class="style_section">



                        <b>Rio de Janeiro</b> is the second largest city in Brazil, on the South Atlantic coast.
                        Rio is famous for its breathtaking landscape, its laid back beach culture and its annual
                        carnival. Although, their soccer skills here are very well recognized.
                        Rio de Janeiro is one of the most visited cities in the Southern Hemisphere and is known for its
                        natural settings, Carnival, samba, bossa nova, and balneario beaches[10] such as Barra da
                        Tijuca, Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon.
                        In addition to the beaches, some of the most famous landmarks include the giant statue of Christ
                        the Redeemer atop Corcovado mountain, named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World;
                        Sugarloaf Mountain with its cable car; the Sambódromo (Sambadrome), a permanent grandstand-lined
                        parade avenue which is used during Carnival; and Maracanã Stadium, one of the world's largest
                        football stadiums.
                        Rio de Janeiro was the host of the 2016 Summer Olympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics, making
                        the city the first South American and Portuguese-speaking city to ever host the events, and the
                        third time the Olympics were held in a Southern Hemisphere city.[11]
                        The Maracanã Stadium held the finals of the 1950 and 2014 FIFA World Cups, the 2013 FIFA
                        Confederations Cup, and the XV Pan American Games.

                    <h3> São Paulo</h3>
                    <section class="style_section">
                        <b>São Paulo</b> is a municipality in the Southeast Region of Brazil. The metropolis is an alpha
                        global city (as listed by the GaWC) and the most populous city in Brazil, the Americas, the
                        Western Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. Additionally, São Paulo is the largest
                        Portuguese-speaking city in the world. The municipality is also the world's 4th largest city
                        proper by population. The city is the capital of the surrounding state of São Paulo, the most
                        populous and wealthiest state in Brazil. It exerts strong international influences in commerce,
                        finance, arts and entertainment. The name of the city honors the Apostle, Saint Paul of Tarsus.
                        The city's metropolitan area, the Greater São Paulo, ranks as the most populous in Brazil and
                        the 12th most populous on Earth. The process of conurbation between the metropolitan areas
                        located around the Greater São Paulo (Campinas, Santos, Sorocaba and São José dos Campos)
                        created the São Paulo Macrometropolis, a megalopolis with more than 30 million inhabitants, one
                        of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world.

                    <h3> Salvador</h3>
                    <section class="style_section">
                        <b>Salvador</b>, also known as São Salvador da Bahia de Todos os Santos (English: Holy Savior of
                        the Bay of All Saints), is the capital of the Brazilian state of Bahia. With 2.9 million people
                        (2017), it is the largest city proper in the Northeast Region and the 4th largest city proper in
                        the country, after São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Brasília.

                        Founded by the Portuguese in 1549 as the first capital of Brazil, Salvador is one of the oldest
                        colonial cities in the Americas. A sharp escarpment divides its Lower Town (Cidade Baixa) from
                        its Upper Town (Cidade Alta) by some 85 meters (279 ft). The Elevador Lacerda, Brazil's first
                        urban elevator, has connected the two since 1873. The Pelourinho district of the upper town,
                        still home to many examples of Portuguese colonial architecture and historical monuments, was
                        named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985. The city's cathedral is the see of the primate of
                        Brazil and its Carnival celebration has been reckoned as the largest party in the world.
                        Salvador was one of the first slave ports in the Americas and the African influence of the
                        slaves' descendants makes it a center of Afro-Brazilian (negro) culture. The city is noted for
                        its cuisine, music, dance and architecture. Porto da Barra Beach in Barra has been named one of
                        the best beaches in the world. Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova was the site of the city's games during
                        the 2014 Brazilian World Cup and 2013 Confederations Cup.

                        Salvador forms the heart of the Recôncavo, Bahia's rich agricultural and industrial maritime
                        district, and continues to be a major Brazilian port. Its metropolitan area, housing 3 899 533
                        people (2018) forms the wealthiest one in Brazil's Northeast Region (2015).
